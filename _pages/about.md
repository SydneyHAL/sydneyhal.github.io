The Sydney Human Augmentation Lab (Sydney HAL) investigates how interactive systems
can extend human capability while remaining usable, trustworthy, and grounded in
real-world contexts.

Human augmentation technologies promise to support perception, decision making,
learning, and mobility. However, many systems fail when deployed outside the lab due
to poor alignment with embodied practice, limited evaluation, or unrealistic assumptions
about users and environments.

Sydney HAL addresses these challenges through:
- human-centred and participatory design
- empirical evaluation in realistic tasks and settings
- interdisciplinary collaboration across design, engineering, and health

The lab prioritises augmentation that complements human skill rather than replacing it,
with a strong focus on accessibility, safety, and long-term adoption.
