## Embodied XR Interaction
We study interaction techniques for virtual and augmented reality that account for
body movement, posture, spatial context, and task demands. This includes work on
retargeting, body-anchored interfaces, and performance-aware interaction design.

## Haptics and Multisensory Feedback
Our research explores self-haptics, wearable feedback, and multisensory cues to support
learning, confidence, and task performance in immersive and non-immersive systems.

## Assistive and Accessible Augmentation
We design augmentation technologies that support diverse abilities, with a focus on
blindness and low vision, mobility, and accessibility-first interaction design.
Evaluation is conducted with stakeholders in realistic contexts.

## Sensing and Human State Modelling
We develop and integrate sensing pipelines including motion, gaze, biosignals, and
contextual sensing to support adaptive and responsive interaction.

## Human-AI Collaboration
Our work investigates how AI systems can augment human capability while remaining
transparent, verifiable, and accountable. We focus on uncertainty communication,
human control, and trust calibration.

## Responsible Augmentation
We examine the ethical, social, and safety implications of augmentation technologies,
including privacy, labour impacts, and misuse, and translate findings into design guidance.
