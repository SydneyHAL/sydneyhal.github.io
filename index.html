excerpt: >
  The Sydney Human Augmentation Lab (Sydney HAL) designs and evaluates technologies
  that extend human perception, action, and capability through rigorous,
  human-centred research.

Sydney HAL is a research lab based at the University of Technology Sydney, focused on
the design, evaluation, and deployment of human augmentation technologies.

Our work spans extended reality, haptics, sensing, and assistive systems, with an
emphasis on real-world use, embodied interaction, and responsible innovation.
We collaborate closely with industry, clinicians, and community partners to ensure
that augmentation technologies are effective, interpretable, and aligned with human needs.
